# Singleton Design Pattern

The **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## When to Use

- When exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
- To control access to shared resources (e.g., configuration, logging).


## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**
- Controlled access to sole instance.
- Reduces memory footprint.

**Cons:**
- Can hide dependencies.
- Difficult to unit test.
